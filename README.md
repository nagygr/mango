# Notes on Go

The file [go.md][1] contains arbitrary notes on development using the Go language. It's
not meant to be an extensive guide nor a source of truth. This is just a shared
personal scratchbook, similar to a cookbook with solutions to miscellaneous problems.

Useful Go packages grouped by topic are listed in [packages.md][2].
