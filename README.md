# Notes on Go

The file [go.md][1] contains arbitrary notes on development using the Go
language. It's not meant to be an extensive guide nor a source of truth. This
is just a shared personal scratchbook, similar to a cookbook with solutions to
miscellaneous problems.

Occasionally, there are Arch-specific installation guidelines. They should be
fairly simple to adapt to other Linux distros -- the package names might be
different. Cross-compilation from Linux to Windows is mentioned whenever it is
relevant. Compilation and working with Go in general on other platforms is not
dealt with as the author has no such experience.

Useful Go packages grouped by topic are listed in [packages.md][2].
